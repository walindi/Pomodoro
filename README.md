## Pomodoro Technique

Recently I've been spending long hours on my computer, way past the point of optimal productivity and with almost no breaks.

While scrolling the internet I came across a time management method called the **Pomodoro Technique**.

Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a kitchen timer to break time into chunks called POMODOROs.
Each pomodoro is typicaly 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

There are five steps to the Pomodoro Technique;
1. Identify task(s)
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes
3. Work on the task for the 25 minutes without distraction
4. Take 5 minute break when alarm sounds
5. After every 4 pomodoros, take a longer 20-30 minute break

I therefore created a Bash Script for that sends a desktop notification after every pomodoro and break. 
I however like to take a break every 30 minutes
